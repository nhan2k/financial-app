# âœ… Angular E2E Workflow Checklist

## ðŸ”¹ Requirement Analysis  
- [ ] What is the core functionality of this feature?  
- [ ] Who are the primary users, and what problem does it solve for them?  
- [ ] Are there any UI/UX requirements or design constraints?  
- [ ] What API endpoints or external services does this feature depend on?  
- [ ] Are there specific security, performance, or accessibility concerns?  
- [ ] What are the expected success criteria or acceptance tests?  

## ðŸ”¹ System Design & Planning  
- [ ] Should we use **Standalone Components**, or is this part of an existing module?  
- [ ] What **state management approach** fits best? (Signals, RxJS, NgRx, or services?)  
- [ ] How will data flow between components and services?  
- [ ] Should this feature be lazy-loaded?  
- [ ] What error handling and logging mechanisms should be implemented?  
- [ ] Are there any route guards, role-based permissions, or authentication requirements?  

## ðŸ”¹ Task Breakdown  
- [ ] What are the key components, services, models, and directives needed?  
- [ ] How should the tasks be divided for efficient parallel development?  
- [ ] What are the dependencies between different parts of the feature?  
- [ ] What should be the order of implementation? (Backend API first? UI first?)  
- [ ] What are the test scenarios we need to cover?  
- [ ] Should we create mock APIs or use real backend endpoints for development?  

## ðŸ”¹ Development  
- [ ] How can we implement this with **reusability** in mind?  
- [ ] Does this component follow **OnPush Change Detection** for performance?  
- [ ] Are we using **RxJS best practices** (e.g., `firstValueFrom`, `BehaviorSubject`)?  
- [ ] How are we managing **dependency injection** (`inject()` vs. `constructor`)?  
- [ ] Are we applying **SCSS best practices** for theming and responsiveness?  
- [ ] How do we handle **edge cases** like API failures, slow networks, or empty states?  

## ðŸ”¹ Code Review & Testing  
- [ ] Does the code follow the **Angular Style Guide**?  
- [ ] Are there **unit tests** and **E2E tests** covering core functionality?  
- [ ] Is the code **modular and reusable**?  
- [ ] Have all unnecessary `console.log()` and unused imports been removed?  
- [ ] Does the API integration correctly handle errors (`catchError`, retry mechanisms)?  
- [ ] Are there potential **performance bottlenecks**?  
- [ ] Are **security best practices** followed (e.g., avoiding hardcoded tokens, sanitizing inputs)?  

## ðŸ”¹ Integration & Deployment  
- [ ] Have all **merge conflicts** been resolved?  
- [ ] Have all **tests passed** in CI/CD?  
- [ ] Have we reviewed the **build size** and **bundle optimization**?  
- [ ] Is the **environment configuration** (staging/production) correctly set?  
- [ ] Do we have **feature flags** if needed for a phased rollout?  
- [ ] Have we created a rollback strategy in case of failure?  

## ðŸ”¹ Post-Deployment Monitoring  
- [ ] Are there any **errors or warnings** in production logs?  
- [ ] How is user feedback on the new feature?  
- [ ] Are there **performance issues** reported after deployment?  
- [ ] Do we need to push any **hotfixes**?  
- [ ] How can we **further optimize** or **improve UX** based on real-world usage?
